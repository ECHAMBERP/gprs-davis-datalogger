# solar panel


- 1W (or more) solar panel with maximum open-circuit voltage of 10 V (for example : large 6V / 3.4W solar panel from Adafruit)




# ATMEGA328 programming


The ATMEGA328 will have to be programmed, at first, with the Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V / 8MHz bootloader. 

You will need, for this, either a dedicated AVR ISP programmer or an "home made" one based on an ARDUINO module

(tutorial : http://letsmakerobots.com/node/35649)


When this will be done, A 3.3V FTDI cable (or an equivalent device) may be used to upload the sketches on the ATMEGA328.

We recommend you, in fact, to follow this option as it is the simplest and quickest way to upload the sketches on the board
from your computer and the Arduino IDE.




# MSP430G2553 programming


The MSP430G2553 can not (at this time) be programmed in situ on the board and thus requires the use of an external programmer.

The simplest and cheapest programmer usable with the ENERGIA IDE is the LAUNCHPAD MSP-EXP430G2, rev 1.5, from Texas Instruments.
